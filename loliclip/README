Lightweight clipboard manager for X

By default it keeps history of your XA_CLIPBOARD,
and keeps XA_PRIMARY on sync with it.

History is saved in XDG_USER_DATA/loliclip or $HOME/.local/loliclip
By default it uses zlib compression.

Change settings in config.h
Also comes with bash script for dmenu access.

lolictrl can read dmenu settings from $HOME/.dmenurc
with the variable LOLICTRL_DMENU, for example:
LOLICTRL_DMENU='dmenu -i -l 15'

MISC:
   You can set clipboard data similar to xsel/xclip
   echo "asd" | loliclip -p # copy to primary
   echo "asd" | loliclip -c # copy to clipboard
   loliclip -p              # output selection from primary
   loliclip -c              # output selection from clipboard

   Special selections are supported as well
   loliclip -b image/png > image.png # get image from gimp
   loliclip -b image/png < image.png # upload image to image/png

Those commands will leave loliclip process open until someone else takes ownership of the particular selection (ex. XA_CLIPBOARD).
