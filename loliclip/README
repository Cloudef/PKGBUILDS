Lightweight clipboard manager for X
config.h coming later.

For now it keeps history of your XA_CLIPBOARD,
and keeps XA_PRIMARY on sync with it.

History is saved in XDG_USER_DATA/loliclip or $HOME/.local/loliclip
By default it uses zlib compression.

Also comes with bash script for dmenu access.


Issues:
   - Settin new selection from command line is slow (compared to xsel, xclip)
   - Print the data from clipboard "as is" (get rid of isprint)
   - Some clipboard owning issues which might be related to slowness of issue #1.
