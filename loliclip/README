Lightweight clipboard manager for X
config.h coming later.

For now it keeps history of your XA_CLIPBOARD,
and keeps XA_PRIMARY on sync with it.

History is saved in XDG_USER_DATA/loliclip or $HOME/.local/loliclip
By default it uses zlib compression.

Also comes with bash script for dmenu access.

MISC:
   You can set clipboard data similar to xsel/xclip
   echo "asd" | loliclip -p # copy to primary
   echo "asd" | loliclip -c # copy to clipboard

Those commands will leave loliclip process open until someone else takes ownership of the particular selection (ex. XA_CLIPBOARD).
