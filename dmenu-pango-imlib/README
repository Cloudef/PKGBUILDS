Pango and imlib patched dmenu.
Thumbnails get cached to $XDG_DATA_HOME/dmenu/imlib.

Pass -g to generate thumbnails immediatly for the piped images.
Pass -is to specify image size (keeping aspect ratio).
Note, that using too big images cause slowdown because images are loaded each time, selection image differs from last image.

Example pipe listing with images:
IMG:/mnt/pictures/lolcat.jpg\tThis is a lolcat\n
IMG:/mnt/pictures/david.jpg\tThis is a picture of david\n
This is a item without a picture\n

Additional options:
Pass -si to specify starting index to dmenu.
ex. -si 5 to start from item 5.
